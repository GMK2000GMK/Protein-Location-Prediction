# Protein-Location-Prediction

This is a machine-learning project designed to predict the location and function of proteins within a cell. Using data sourced from the UniProt database, the project gathers information on protein interactions and related features for cellular components like the mitochondria, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying proteins based on their cellular location and predicting their biological functions. This research aims to advance our understanding of protein behaviour, with potential applications in bioinformatics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine by streamlining the identification of protein roles within cellular processes.
